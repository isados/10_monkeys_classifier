# 10 Monkey Species Classifier using 6 Lines of Code

This is a Google-Colab ready notebook and worked really well with their GPU, but you could basically run it on any server or local machine.

To install FastAI run this, or use Anaconda for Windows.
```bash
pip3 install fastai=2.5.2
```

For results and explanations, read the notebook. Though I recommend reading it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iY_SoK2oFrgx6k_kKHv-HK331Oc4IiuT?usp=sharing) for the cleanest look.
